# Impact QGIS Plugin

![staging](https://github.com/anyways-open/impact-qgis-plugin/workflows/staging/badge.svg)  

This repo contains the code for the **Impact toolbox** plugin for QGIS.

This plugin has been developed to automate our Routing API and ease the subsequent routing analysis by importing all calculated routings (combined or separately) in QGIS. However, this is just the beginning of developing a fantastic toolbox that not only automates but also links our APIs to facilitate mobility-related analysis in multiple levels. Some examples of these analyses are as follows:
- Netwrok analysis
- Accessibility analysis & assessment
- **Impact analysis** (e.g., traffic shift due to the closure of a level crossing)
- etc.
